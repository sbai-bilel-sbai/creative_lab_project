					<h1>CONTEST PREREGISTRATION</h1>
					<p class="para">
						WHY PRE-REGISTER FOR THE CONTEST?
						We always receive far more entries than we have room to accommodate in the Cosplay Contest so, in the spirit of fairness, we accept contestants into the contest on a first-come, first-served basis. By pre-registering you guarantee yourself a spot in the Cosplay Contest. Attendees who pre-register also have priority in prejudging appointments and have the ability to book their prejudging appointment before the convention. While we still offer on-site registration during the convention weekend, those spots go fast! If you know you want to enter the contest, pre-registering is the way to go!
